\section{Rejection Sampling}

This method is very commonly used in quantum simulations to simulate the measurement process. Code in various languages to preform this method can be found in my past programs.  As such to maximize the amount I can take away from this exercise I will not go into depth here and instead concentrate on the other two methods.

\section{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}

follows a random walk \\
could get stuck in a region of $f(x)$


\section{Inverse Transform Sampling}

need to create an inverse of the function \\
best to do that numerically \\
would need very small $\Delta$ as continuous\\
memory usage high to store array for inverse\\
in the given example each probability will have to x values\\
need flip coin to determine if grater then or less then $\mu$
